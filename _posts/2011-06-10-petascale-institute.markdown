I attended a 2-week Intensive Workshop as part of the Blue Waters Undergraduate Petascale Education Program internship training. I will be working on the internship starting this summer and during the following two semesters (Fall '11 & Spring '12).  The Petascale Institute took place at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus.

During the 2 weeks, we were exposed to important topics in high performance computing (HPC): Supercomputing, storage hierarchy, scientific computing, distributed memory parallelism, MPI (Message Passing Interface) coding, GPGPU, OpenMP coding & debugging, hybrid parallel programming, Blue Waters architecture, performance, visualization, and many more...
